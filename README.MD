# Overview
The goal of this hackathon project is about providing a simple way of spinning up a docker image for Magento 2 with a base installation and sample-data.

We’re going to split this up into a couple steps:
- Docker host installation
- Installing the docker system
- Compiling standardized docker images for multiple purposes and make them distributable oder GitHub or DockerHub
- Have a CLI tool to compile the compose.yml file that’s going to be used by the docker-compose tool

## Prerequisites
### Docker host
#### Vagrant
